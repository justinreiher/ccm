Coho-Model(CCM): Coho Circuit Modeling Tool
  CCM is a toolset for simplifying the circuit model works for both simulation and formal verification. 
  It provide a object-oriented circuit interface for users, which enables reuse and easily extension. 
  Users only need to specify the circuit layout, the tool will automatically provide ODE interface for simulation, 
  or linear differential inclusion interface for formal verification, and do the optimization automatically.
  
 Extension by Justin Reiher(2018-2020):
  The nested bisection algorithm has been included as specific testbench that can be instantiated for synchronizer circuits to simulate metastable trajectories upto a user specified time. (examples and documentation provided)
  
  In addition an analysis testbench can be created to determine a synchronizer's gain, instantaneous gain and gradient calculation of the gain with respect to the transistor widths. In order to make use of the analysis tools, the IntLAB toolbox is required found at: http://www.ti3.tu-harburg.de/intlab/

Details on obtaining and paying for the toolbox can be found there.

Without the IntLAB toolbox you can still simulate circuits and run the nested bisection algorithm described in manual.v2.pdf
